Although the syntax of Md and Wiki are pretty similar they are not the same
Some example
* *italic*
* **bold**
* A [search engine](http://google.com "Google")
* A cross [reference][search engine]
  * Indented enumerations
* Or just numbered ones:
1. Item to check
2. Item checked 
  1. Is this even possible?
  2. Yes
